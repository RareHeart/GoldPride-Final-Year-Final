# GoldPride-Final-Year-Project

Gold Pride Events is an events management service that deals with creating and management of events that clients envision to minimize the stress and hassle of having to undergo the process of planning events on their own. Gold Pride Events is currently using an unreliable manual filing system. In this project we hope to eliminate the unnecessary and outdated storage methods of event management by introducing a simple, yet elegant system that will be able to handle customer needs while still maintaining a good client relationship. The application will assist in managing stock inventory, client-business meetings, evaluation the success of the events, and online payment.
